# NLP-WordCloud
NLP Word Cloud:This project is an implementation of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline that generates word clouds from textual data. The goal of this assignment is to visualize the most frequent words in a given text dataset, providing insights into the main topics and themes.

Features:
* Text Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and performing tokenization.
* Word Frequency Analysis: Analyzes the frequency of words in the processed text data.
* Word Cloud Generation: Creates a word cloud visualization, where the size of each word represents its frequency in the dataset.
* Customization Options: Allows customization of the word cloud, including color schemes, maximum number of words, and shape of the cloud.

Technologies Used:
* Python: The main programming language used for the project.
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing and tokenization.
* Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the word cloud.
* WordCloud Library: Specifically used for generating the word cloud.
